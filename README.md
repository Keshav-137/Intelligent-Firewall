## 📌 Overview

**Intelligent Firewall** is an advanced **AI-powered Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)** system that combines traditional firewall security, machine learning-based threat detection, endpoint detection, and Zero Trust security principles into a single integrated security platform.

Unlike traditional firewalls that rely only on predefined rules, this system uses:

* Real-time packet inspection
* Rule-based traffic filtering
* Machine learning threat classification
* Endpoint monitoring
* Process behavior analysis
* Identity-based access control
* Automated incident response

The goal is to provide a complete **multi-layer network defense system** capable of detecting, analyzing, and responding to modern cyber threats.
